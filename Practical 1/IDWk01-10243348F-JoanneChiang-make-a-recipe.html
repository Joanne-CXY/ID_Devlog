                <li>14g - 20g salted butter</li>
                <li>or 2 tsp mild olive oil instead</li>

        <h2>Method:</h2>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>Add all ingredients (A), except for the butter to a large bowl and stir with a hard spatula to slightly bring everything together. <br> Then, knead with your hands for about 15-20 minutes.  </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Add room temperature salted butter and knead until it's fully incorporated.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li> Cover with a lid or tea towel and allow to proof until doubled in size in a warm place about 30 minutes to 1 hour. <br>  (Do not let the bread dough direct sunlight or proof above 38/40ËšC). </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Punch down the dough after its first rise. The large air bubbles are removed to help reduce the dough rises and many air pockets are formed inside. <br> Sprinkle flour on the worktop. <br> Cut the dough into 4 even pieces. To shape into a round balls and roll each in a long log, roll up and pinch the seam. <br> Then place them on a prepared bread pan and second proof again for another 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Before baking, check the dough if it rise until just above the rim and press the dough gently with your finger if it springs back slowly and leaves a small indent it is now ready to bake.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li> You can bake your sandwich bread covered or leave uncovered. No preheat air-fryer 150C and bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Allow the bread to cool completely before slicing. Store bread covered at room temperature within a day.</li>
